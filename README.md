<h1>PythonKeyLogger</h1>
As you guys all know python is a pretty powerful language which can be utilized for any purpose. And so in this repository I would like to make you an even big fan of python by building a simple keylogger with just a few lines of code. So lets get started. First of all in case you are not aware keylogger is a a computer program that records every keystroke made by a computer user, especially in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information. Keylogger for Windows
